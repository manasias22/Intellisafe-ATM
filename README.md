# "Pandemic-Resilient ATM: Enabling Contactless and Card less Transactions using Computer Vision"

## Problem Statement:
The issue addressed in this project pertains to the imperative need for safe and contactless ATM
utilization in the midst of a pandemic, with a primary emphasis on mitigating the risk of viral
transmission. Amid the pandemic, this predicament is being tackled through a series of prudent
measures, encompassing ATM sterilization, provision of hand sanitizers, and the
implementation of effective queue management strategies. This collective approach serves to
redress the issue by furnishing safer avenues for ATM usage while concurrently enhancing
public awareness regarding safety protocols.
Our system leverages an advanced computer vision model, seamlessly integrated with a camera
module, to meticulously discern and track the movements of a user's hand. This user-interface
interaction is facilitated by means of a visual cursor displayed on the ATM screen. It enables
users to effortlessly navigate through the interface and execute transactions using two distinct
finger movements before the camera. Upholding the paramount principle of security, the
authentication process hinges on a combination of the user's registered phone number and a
one-time password (OTP). Upon successful authentication, users are granted access to a
spectrum of transactions, which can be finalized by inputting their personal ATM PIN.
